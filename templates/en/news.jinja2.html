      <h3>CFP and Financial Assistance Openings</h3>

      <p>
        The PyConFR 2024 <a href="https://cfp.pycon.fr/pyconfr-2024/cfp">CFP (Call For Proposal)</a> is now open!
      </p>
      <p>
        The CFP allows you to propose your topics for sprints, conferences and workshops.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>You can submit your proposals until July 21, 2024</strong>. At the end of
        the open period, AFPy Steering Committee members will review all
        proposals and the planning can be made!
      </p>
      <p>
        You can propose topics in French or English. As AFPy promotes
        the Python language to the French-speaking community, we are
        keen to keep the majority of the program in French (~80%).
      </p>
      <p>
        Following feedback from the previous edition, you can indicate
        the level of the target audience for your proposals, as well as
        the language in which you will be presenting. This will enable
        us to include the information in the program and avoid any
        disappointments :).
      </p>

      <p>
        Financial assistance applications are also open!
      </p>
      <p>
        As we do every year, we're offering financial assistance to help
        students and people who can't afford to come to PyConFR.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can apply by e-mail to our treasurer
        (<a href="mailto:tresorier@afpy.org">tresorier@afpy.org</a>). Please see the <a href="{{ url_for('page', name='financial', lang=lang) }}">Financial Assistance</a>
        page for details of how to apply.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Applications are open until September 30, 2024</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        ⚠️ After these dates, we will no longer accept subject
        proposals or financial assistance applications.
