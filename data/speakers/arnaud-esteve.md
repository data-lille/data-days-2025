"Data Engineer by accident" is probably the most accurate bio I can think of.

Got a Telecom Engineering degree, worked in Software for a while, then turned into Data Engineering just because our teams needed to. This is where I first learned about Apache Kafka and Apache Spark. And here I am, navigating my way across "all things data".

I once was a Solutions Engineer at Confluent, helping people implement their event streaming data strategies using Apache Kafka and its ecosystem on a daily basis.

And even before that, I worked for Decathlon, in charge of projects such as Stock Management or Loyalty Program.  
We have moved data, migrated to the cloud, changed RDBMS, jumped on the microservice bandwagon, always trying to bring value to Sport lovers in the process. 
A nice mix of  software, data engineering as well as architecture for 6 amazing years.

I like writing software in Python, Rust or Scala, solving puzzles at times as well as experimenting with new languages & frameworks (Elm, ...)

Based in Barcelona, I love running, cycling in the wilds as well as landscape photography.
