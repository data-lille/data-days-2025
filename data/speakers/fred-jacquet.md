With over 20 years of experience navigating the intersection of **AI**, **data**, and **ethics**, I’ve seen enough technological "*apocalypses*" to know what separates hype from reality. 

As a researcher, speaker, and strategic advisor, I’ve guided companies in developing ethical, data-driven, and AI-enabled business strategies. 

From roles as Solution Architect to CTO and Chief Innovation Officer, I’ve led organizations through transformative journeys, leveraging advanced analytics, cutting-edge AI, and human-centered innovation to drive meaningful change.
From presenting findings at the “**Summit International Databricks AI+Data**” to addressing ethical dilemmas at **“Big Data & AI” in Paris**, my mission at [AI[4]HumanNexus](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacquetfred/), remains clear: *explore the real-world impacts of technology while debunking the myths and exaggerated fears that surround it*.
