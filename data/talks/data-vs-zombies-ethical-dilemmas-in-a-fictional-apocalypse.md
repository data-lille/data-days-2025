short_description: "In a **zombie apocalypse-style** dilemma, survival isn’t just\
  \ about outrunning the undead—it’s about **confronting ethical data decisions**,\
  \ because even in chaos, **privacy and fairness matter**! \nFrom deploying surveillance\
  \ drones to identify infected individuals, to sharing personal data for survival\
  \ coordination, and using AI to allocate limited resources, the dilemmas we face\
  \ in this fictional scenario mirror **real-world challenges in data ethics**.\n\n\
  This talk explores how extreme situations can spotlight *ethical decisions we already\
  \ confront in everyday life*. \n\nThrough engaging storytelling, practical examples,\
  \ and a touch of humor, we’ll examine questions like: \n- Who decides what data\
  \ is collected during a crisis? \n- How do we balance privacy with safety? \n- And\
  \ what happens to sensitive data after the crisis ends?\n\nThe idea of this presentation\
  \ is to mix pop culture references with technical insights and societal analysis.\n\
  The session intends to make data ethics accessible and relevant to technical and\
  \ non-technical audiences alike. Participants will leave with fresh insights into\
  \ the ethical implications of data-driven decisions and a new perspective on why\
  \ ethical considerations are essential—even when facing a “zombie apocalypse”."
