In a **zombie apocalypse-style** dilemma, survival isn’t just about outrunning the undead—it’s about **confronting ethical data decisions**, because even in chaos, **privacy and fairness matter**! 
From deploying surveillance drones to identify infected individuals, to sharing personal data for survival coordination, and using AI to allocate limited resources, the dilemmas we face in this fictional scenario mirror **real-world challenges in data ethics**.

This talk explores how extreme situations can spotlight *ethical decisions we already confront in everyday life*. 

Through engaging storytelling, practical examples, and a touch of humor, we’ll examine questions like: 
- Who decides what data is collected during a crisis? 
- How do we balance privacy with safety? 
- And what happens to sensitive data after the crisis ends?

The idea of this presentation is to mix pop culture references with technical insights and societal analysis.
The session intends to make data ethics accessible and relevant to technical and non-technical audiences alike. Participants will leave with fresh insights into the ethical implications of data-driven decisions and a new perspective on why ethical considerations are essential—even when facing a “zombie apocalypse”.
